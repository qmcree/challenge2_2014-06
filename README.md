Laravel 4.2

# Directions #

1. Display all of the offers in the list box, allowing multi-select, or selection of "Show All Offers" (same as no selection)
2. Display possible countries in the country dropdown box, as a filter. It merely needs to filter the results, not the offer list box. (Some offers may be available in more than one country.)
3. Have all fields retain selected values upon form submit; Have date fields default to today's date
4. Have a footer with totals for the data
5. Note: Conversion rate is the ratio of clicks to leads ;  EPC is revenue divided by clicks
